<h2>What did you do? (TODO: remove question)</h2>

Your project abstract: one catchy sentence followed by a paragraph or two. The intended audience should include people that aren't necessarily versed in Computer Architecture, but are technically competent.

<h2>Why did you do it? (TODO: remove question)</h2>

A paragraph or so about why the project you chose is worthwhile and interesting.

<h2>How did you do it? (TODO: remove question)</h2>

This portion can assume an audience that has taken Computer Architecture, but don't let the story you’re telling get bogged down by buzzwords. A sure sign of a bad engineer is ORA (over reliance on acronyms).

<h2>How can someone else build on it? (TODO: remove question)</h2>

Include everything necessary to pick up where you left off. This should include (as appropriate):
<ul>
    <li>code</li>
    <li>schematics</li>
    <li>scripts and build instructions</li>
    <li>proper attribution for resources used and anything you did not write yourself</li>
    <li>list of difficulties and ‘gotchas’ while doing this project</li>
    <li>reflection on the project as a whole as well as your work plan</li>
    <li>possible TODOs to extend the depth of the project</li>
</ul>
This should all be posted somewhere accessible, e.g. your project webpage or repository.
Please do not literally include these question prompts and then answer them (you're better than that) - instead, use them to check that you've covered all the bases as you tell the story in the way that best makes sense for your project
