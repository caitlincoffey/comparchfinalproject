      <!---<h2>What did you do?  </h2>

      Your project abstract: one catchy sentence followed by a paragraph or two. The intended audience should include
      people that aren't necessarily versed in Computer Architecture,
      but are technically competent.--->

      <!--- <h2>Why did you do it?  </h2>

      A paragraph or so about why the project you chose is worthwhile and interesting.

      <h2>How did you do it?  </h2>

      This portion can assume an audience that has taken Computer Architecture, but
      don't let the story youâ€™re telling get bogged down by buzzwords. A sure sign of a bad engineer is ORA (over reliance on acronyms).

      <h2>How can someone else build on it? </h2>

      Tinstead, use them to check that you've covered all the bases as you tell the story in the way that best makes sense for your project
      --->

      If you can think back to any projects you have done that involved manipulating large matrices of data that could have been completed in parallel (Machine Learning, QEA, etc.),
      you probably remember how long those projects would take to run. Maybe they even crashed under the weight of your expectations.

      Understanding the performance differences between a Central Processing Unit (CPU) and a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) helps tremendously to not only process graphics, but also fluid dynamics,
      cryptography, neural networks, genome mapping, computational finance, and really any two or three dimensional analysis that can be ran in parallel. Knowing how offloading certain tasks to
      the GPU affects performance is key to reducing the time and power it takes to run these computations. These kinds of tasks are called General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU),
      and refer to tasks that were historically handled on the CPU that can now be handled on the GPU.
    </p>
    <p>
      For our project, our team focused on analyzing the performance of two different Machine Learning algorithms that were designed to run on the CPU and GPU.
      To perform these computations our team used CUDA, a closed-source program developed by Nvidia that contains hardware and software support for General-Purpose computing on Nvidia GPUs.
      The algorithms were ran several times on the CPU vs. the CPU and GPU with sample datasets changing in size. Other variables such as [TODO add] were kept constant as controls.
      [TODO explain more how computations were done]
    </p>
      Our findings explain the architectural differences between the CPU and GPU, the hardware and software support of CUDA, and possible explanations for the
      runtime differences in both scripts over the CPU vs. the CPU and GPU. We chose to package our most vaulable information from our learning
      into a <b>zine</b>. You can view it <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L-YfC4NAyVFYnJ9r2aHBQ-z6jgq4Gt-wT_quFm4rLjw/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> or
      by clicking the Zine tab on the top of the page.

      Most of our in-detail documentation is written up on Notion. You can view our documentation <a href="">here</a> or by clicking on the Documentation tab.
